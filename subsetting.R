# This script reads in the training data and subsets the names of genes
# into those included in the essentiality file (Those for which we are supposed
# to predict essentiality scores - Achilles_v2.9_training.gct), those which
# overlap with the expression and copy number data, and those for which all
# data is available.
# The gene names themselves, from the Description field, are written to text files
# and the data frame is then subsetted (someone verify that this part works?)
